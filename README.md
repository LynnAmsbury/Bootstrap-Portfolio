# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A portfolio made in the spirit of the Basic Portfolio, but using Bootstrap.

Overview:

In this assignment, create a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

Using Bootstrap, recreate your Basic Portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows, and columns are your friends)

On xs and sm screens, content should take up the entire screen. On md and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!
